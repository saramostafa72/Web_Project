            Recently Hawawshi could be filled with sausage or pastrami instead of the minced meat.<br> Most of the butchers make Hawawshi in their shops nowadays, and it is also made at homes. <br>It is very delicious and everyone will be satisfied after eating it.</p>

          <p>You could think of Om Ali as the Egyptian cousin of the ever-so-popular bread pudding. <br> Same idea of soaking some type of bready carb with dairy and sugar and baking it in the oven. <br> Om Ali skips the eggs though, which makes it lighter in texture, looser and milkier as opposed to custardy.   Instead of bread, <br>it is traditionally made with baked puff pastry, phyllo or roaa (Egyptian flat bread) combined with milk and nuts.</p>

            Sawabe’ Zainab is one of the most popular Egyptian desserts, and there is two stories behind this name. <br><span class="red"> First one is</span> that there was a very clever girl who invented this sweet. When she served it to the visitors, they said “Teslam Sawabe’ Zainab” which means May god bless Zainab’s fingers.<br>
            
           <span class="red">The second story is</span> : that Sawabe’ Zainab is after the name of Ms. Zainab, Al-Hussain’s daughter (May Allah be pleased with him). Because Egyptian people love Ms. Zainab so much and because that sweet is very popular, they called it after her name.
            
            It is a dough prepared by mixing semolina, flour, sugar, and other sweets’ ingredients that impart a great taste.<br> It also has a sugared taste as it is dipped in syrup, and you can dress it as you wish.<br> It also can be served at all times, whether mornings or evenings. It is one of the popular desserts of Ramadan. </p>
