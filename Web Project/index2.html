            <p>One of Brazil's favorite street foods, coxinha (lit. little thigh) is a crispy croquette filled with chicken meat and cream cheese that is cleverly shaped into a chicken drumstick, then breaded and deep-fried.<br>
                 Coxinha originated around São Paulo in the 19th century, and by the 1950s it spread to Rio de Janeiro and Paraná, having now become one of the most popular salgados (savory appetizers) across the country.<br>
                Legend has it that coxinha was first made for the Brazilian princess Isabel's son who only liked chicken thigh meat. However, according to food historians, it was probably invented during the industrialization of São Paulo to be marketed as a cheaper and more durable substitute to traditional chicken cuts that were sold at the gates of local factories as snacks for the workers.<br>
                Nowadays, coxinhas can be found anywhere from Brazilian snack bars called lanchonetes, cafés, buffets and even bakeries to numerous stand-up lunch counters and street food stalls.<br>
                The perfect coxinha has a golden, crunchy crust which envelopes the chicken stock and flour dough and breaks away into its creamy interior made with shredded chicken breast and Catupiry requeijão cremoso cheese.<br>
                It is typically flavored with onion, garlic, cilantro, and lime. For a well-rounded snack, these delicious Brazilian chicken-filled nibbles are usually served with hot chili sauce, vinaigrette or garlic mayonnaise, and best enjoyed with a glass of cold beer.</p>

                <p>Rabanada is the Brazilian version of french toast. <br>
                    It's made with round or oval stale bread cut in thick slices that's dipped in milk (or milk, sugar, and vanilla) and beaten eggs, fried in oil, then sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.<br>
                     As a result, rabanada is sweeter and crunchier than the American french toast.<br>
                   The first mention of rabanada dates back to the 15th century, when it was described by Juan del Encina as a dish that's helpful for recovery from childbirth, which is why rabanada is alsko known as fatia parida, meaning slices for the new mom.<br>
                   The first recipe dates back to the 17th century, and by the beginning of the 20th century, the treat was commonly served in the taverns of Madrid, accompanied by jugs of wine. <br>
                   Nowadays in Brazil, in the province of Minho, rabanada is often drizzled with a wine syrup, and it's especially popular during the festive Christmas season throughout the country.</p>

                      Today, there are numerous variations on the dish, so the type of beans and meat vary from one part of the country to the next. <br>
                      It is believed that the dish was invented during the Brazilian Colonial period, when tropeiros used to sell things while traveling on horses, bringing beans, manioc flour, and dried meat with them on long journeys.</p>

                        It is placed into a baking dish, then topped with mashed potatoes, and often grated cheese. The combination is baked in the oven until golden brown on top. <br>
                        The name of the dish means little hidden one, referring to the meat hidden underneath a layer of mashed potatoes.</p>

                        This beef cut is long and thin, full of connective tissue.<br>
                        This strong marbling is the reason why the meat is traditionally cut against the grain before it's grilled.<br>
                        The name fraldinha is a diminutive for fralda, meaning flap or diaper in Portuguese. When prepared for churrasco, it usually has a browned crust at the edges, while the middle remains pink. <br>
                        It's recommended to top this meat cut with a sharp and vinegary salsa.</p>

                      It consists of peeled beans or black-eyed peas that are formed into a ball, deep-fried in dendé palm oil, split in half, then stuffed with flavorful, spicy pastes made from numerous ingredients such as cashews, palm oil, and shrimp.<br>
                      The most common accompaniments to the dish include a tomato salad and homemade hot pepper sauces.<br>
                      The recipe for the dish originated during the colonial period of the country, from the Nigerian slaves who first started selling it on the streets of Brazil.<br>
                      Today, acarajé represents a good example of how African influences have been shaping Brazil's cultural heritage and its culinary identity.</p>

                   The dish is a combination of four elements that are neatly organized and served together as a complete meal. <br>
                   The essential parts are sliced, sun-dried beef, diced and mixed vegetable vinaigrette, beans, typically black eyed peas, and farofa – a toasted cassava flour mixture.<br>
                   All of the ingredients are seasoned with clarified butter, neatly arranged and served on a plate.<br>
                  The four elements of arrumadinho can either be mixed or consumed as individual dishes.<br>
                   A plate of arrumadinho is usually shared by a couple or a group of people, typically followed by a glass of cold beer or a freshly prepared caipirinha.<br>
                  The dish can usually be found in the northeast of Brazil, more precisely in the state of Pernambuco, where it is believed to have originated.<br>
                   It is often sold at food stands as a snack, but it is also commonly served as an appetizer in elegant restaurants. </p>

                Carne de sol is traditionally prepared with either beef or goat meat, and the origins of this centuries-old meat preservation method are attributed to the so-called sertanejos, cattle ranchers living in the vast, semi-arid Brazilian hinterlands.<br>
                Today, carne de sol is a delicacy found all across the country and, if not grilled or cubed and used in various stews, it is typically served with coalho cheese and accompanied by a thick manioc gruel called pirão or boiled cassava.</p>
