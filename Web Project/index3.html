                 <p>Salt and pepper calamari is a Chinese cuisine-inspired dish that’s so popular in Australia it might even be called one of Australia’s national dishes. <br>
                    The calamari, or squid in some cases, is covered in salt-and-pepper batter, then deep-fried to crispy perfection.<br>
                    The dish is often prepared and served as a bar or pub snack, and it often comes garnished with garlic, fried chili, and spring onions.<br>
                    Salt and pepper calamari is so widely available in the country that it can be found everywhere from cafés to pubs, restaurants, and bistros.<br>
                    The only thing that’s important is that the seafood should be fresh, and the seafood to batter ratio should be similar in size and coating.</p>

                 <p>Anzac biscuits are sweet cookies made from a combination of flour, oats, golden syrup, butter, sugar, coconut, and soda bicarbonate. Although the origins of these cookies are not clear, both Australia and New Zealand claim to have invented Anzac biscuits that we know today.<br>
                   The first known recipe for the biscuits is completely different than modern Anzacs, although other similar recipes were found in the cookbooks of the early 1900s. The cookies are linked to Anzac Day, a day of remembrance of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) landing at Gallipoli, because some believe that the biscuits were sent to Anzac soldiers during the war.<br>
                   However, the oaty, buttery biscuits were more often prepared at home to sell them at fundraising events, so they got connected to the war, and it led to the use of the name Anzacs.<br>
                  Today, these simple biscuits are usually found in most supermarkets and cafés throughout Australia and New Zealand, ranging from crispy to chewy, making them ideal to dunk into a cup of hot coffee or tea.</p>

                <div class="text">
                 <p>A pie floater is an Australian dish that is most commonly consumed in Adelaide and Sydney.<br>
                  It consists of a traditional Australian meat pie that is usually submerged upside-down in green pea soup.<br>
                  It is believed that the origins of the dish lie in traditional English dishes of pea soup with eel and suet dumplings (dumplings in soups were known as floaters).<br>
                  The usual accompaniments to a pie floater include tomato sauce or mint sauce, Worcestershire sauce, or malt vinegar.<br>
                  Pie floater has an impressive history that can be traced back to over 130 years. It was invented in Port Pirie, South Australia in the 1890s by a bakery operator named Ern "Shorty" Bradley.<br>
                  he floaters became popular at many pie carts that were in function in Adelaide in the late 19th and early 20th century, with 13 carts operating in the city. <br>
                  Although the last pie cart was closed recently, in 2010, floaters are still present in numerous bakeries, available to everyone who wants a late evening meal.<br>
                  The popularity of the dish is evident in the fact that it was recognized as a South Australian Heritage Icon by the National Trust of Australia in 2003.</p>

                <p>Chicken parmigiana is a poultry dish consisting of breadcrumbs-coated chicken breasts that are topped with tomato sauce and cheese, then baked until the cheese melts and the chicken is properly cooked.<br>
                 Although it has an Italian-sounding name, chicken parmigiana is actually an American dish, derived from an Italian dish called melanzana alla parmigiana, or eggplant parmesan.<br>
                 No one knows who invented chicken parmigiana, but it is very popular in American cities with a large number of Italian immigrants such as New York and New Jersey.<br>
                 Regardless of the origin, the dish is usually served on top of rice or pasta, while some prefer it as a part of submarine sandwiches.<br>
                 Chicken parmigiana is also very popular in Australia, where it is a staple in numerous pubs, often served with salads and chips on the side.</p>

                There are many recipes for this hearty home-cooked soup, so ingredients may vary from one cook to another.<br>
                Besides being easy to prepare, the soup is also a great way to use up leftover roast chicken.<br>

            Besides Australia, these pancakes are also popular in Scotland, Wales, and New Zealand.<br>
            The batter for pikelets is slightly thicker than the one used for American pancakes, which makes them heavy once they have risen in the pan.<br>
            They are small in size, and are often made with yeast, while American pancakes are prepared with baking powder. <br>
            Once done, pikelets can be served hot or cold, preferably with butter, syrups, and fruits on the side, which are used as toppings.</p>
