            <p>Arguably the most laborious Turkish soup and one of Gaziantep's favorites, yuvarlama çorbası is made with spiced meatballs, chickpeas, yogurt broth, olive oil, and other optional ingredients. <br>
             The soup is traditionally prepared for the three-day celebration of the fast-breaking Ramazan Bayramı, and it is served in virtually every Anatolian home.<br>
             The preparation of this festive soup is a time-consuming process, and everyone is involved, as often both family members and neighbors get together to share the work and joy of rolling hundreds of tiny yuvarlama köfte.<br> 
             These spiced meatballs are typically made with lean beef mince, and either rice or bulgur flour, but they can also be made without meat.<br>
             Köfte are then steamed and, together with pre-cooked chickpeas, added to the warm süzme or strained yogurt broth drizzled with minty olive oil.<br>
             Yuvarlama soup can even include stewed chunks of beef, lamb, or chicken, and it is most often accompanied by rice pilaf, which altogether makes not only for quite a nutritious meal but also an amazing combination of different flavors and textures.</p>

                <p>A specialty of the city of Bursa, Iskender kebap is named after a butcher called İskender Bey, who first prepared this flavorful dish. <br>
                  It consists of thinly sliced lamb that is grilled and combined with a spicy tomato sauce and pita bread, while melted sheep butter and yogurt are traditionally drizzled over the dish at the table. <br>
                  It is recommended to pair this kebap with şıra, a Turkish beverage that is known to aid digestion.</p>

                    <p>A great example of Turkish regional cuisine, Ezogelin çorbası is a hearty, mint-flavored soup made with red lentils, bulgur, pepper paste, and various Turkish spices. <br>
                    The origins of this classic Turkish winter dish are attributed to an unhappily married woman named Ezo who lived in the village of Dokuzyol near Gaziantep in the early 20th century.<br>
                    It is believed that Ezo used to make this soul-warming soup in a desperate effort to win over her mother-in-law's cold heart.<br>
                    Ezo's story was often depicted in films and lamented in folksongs, and her name still lives on in this flavorful dish.<br>
                    Today, apart from being served as a warm starter or even as a breakfast meal, Ezogelin çorbası is traditionally prepared as soul food for the young brides-to-be in order to sustain them for the marital journey that lies ahead.</p>

                    <div class="text">
                     <p>Even though lahmacun is popularly nicknamed Turkish pizza, that name doesn't really do justice to what this crunchy, doughy treat topped with spicy minced meat truly represents.<br>
                        In Turkey, lahmacun is the ultimate street food and a favorite lunchtime snack.<br>
                        It can be found at numerous street stalls as well as in virtually any traditional Turkish restaurant, but also in kebab eateries where they typically serve mini lahmacuns as appetizers. <br>
                        The perfect lahmacun is made by rolling a ball of sturdy semolina dough into a thin disc which is only lightly spread with meat - either lamb or beef, minced to a paste together with chili, onions, and other seasonings.<br>
                        The dish is then shortly baked in a super-hot (and preferably wood-fired) oven. <br>
                        Lahmacun is best served hot with a drizzle of lemon juice. It is traditionally enjoyed folded around the crispy onions and a parsley salad known as piyaz.<br>
                        It is recommended to pair lahmacun either with the salty, cold yogurt beverage called ayran, or şalgam suyu, the barrel-fermented juice of red carrot pickles, which is salted, spiced, and flavored with the aromatic turnip called çelem.</p>

                      The dish is consumed as a meze, and it is typically served almost cold.<br>
                      In recent years, due to food safety regulations and health concerns, the meat is nowadays almost always replaced with bulgur and ground walnuts, but these vegetarian versions are so good that people mostly can’t tell them from the real thing.</p>

                     The dough is filled with ingredients such as meat, vegetables, eggs, various cheeses, or mushrooms, and is then baked on a sac griddle.<br>
                     Originally, gözleme was served for breakfast or as a light afternoon snack, but today it has a status of popular fast food that can be found throughout the country's restaurants, food carts, and cafés.</p>
