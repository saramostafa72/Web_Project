            <p>Puchero is a hearty Spanish stew belonging to the cuisine of the poor, featuring different types of meat, rice, noodles, and vegetables such as chickpeas, cabbage, carrots, and potatoes.<br>
              The name of the dish, puchero, means stewpot, referring to the big clay pots in which the stew was originally prepared.<br>
              Traditionally, puchero is consumed over several days, and each time it is accompanied by a different side dish. <br>
              Thick and flavorful, this stew is often consumed during the colder days of the year.</p>

                <p>Rice and seafood are the key ingredients to making arroz marinero, a traditional specialty that originates from Spain.  <br>
                  The main ingredients are usually combined with sautéed vegetables such as onions, peppers, tomatoes, and garlic, and the combination is typically simmered in water or stock (seafood or fish stock) with the addition of various spices and seasonings. <br>
                  Like many other Spanish dishes, this one has also entered the traditional cuisines of the Spanish colonies with the introduction of rice and is nowadays associated with South American countries such as Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. <br>
                  The variations on the dish abound throughout Spain and the Latin American countries, with each country having its own version of this rice specialty. <br>
                  In Spain, the dish is usually prepared with short-grain varieties of rice such as bomba or Arborio, while in South America, arroz marinero typically consists of long-grain rice. <br>
                  Another crucial difference between the Spanish and South American versions of the dish is the use of different spices, which are typical of the regions where the dish is being prepared.</p>

                 <p>Albóndigas en salsa is a traditional Spanish dish that's typically eaten as a tapa. <br>
                  This appetizer consists of meatballs in rich tomato sauce.<br>
                  The small meatballs are often made with a combination of beef, pork, veal (or a combination of the three), breadcrumbs, parsley, eggs, garlic, flour, and seasonings, while the sauce is made with garlic, onions, tomatoes, red wine, olive oil, paprika, salt, and stock.<br>
                  Before cooking them in the sauce, the meatballs are usually lightly browned.<br>
                  When the sauce becomes thick, the dish is served, often with crusty bread and a glass of red wine on the side. It is believed that these meatballs originated as a Berber or Arab dish which was brought over to Spain during the Muslim rule.<br>
                  The name is derived from the Arabic word al-bunduq, meaning hazelnut, referring to the small size of the meatballs.</p>

                 Both options are well-seasoned and mixed with cooked and flaked salt cod before the dough is shaped into desired forms.<br>
                 Each piece is coated in breadcrumbs and finally fried until golden and crispy.<br>
                 The cod version is one of the most common types of croquetas found in Spain, and like other varieties, it is a staple tapas dish enjoyed throughout the country.</p>
